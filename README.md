VGScoreboardPing
================

This plugin will display players ping on the scoreboard list(tab)
This is the ScoreboardPing module standalone from VG Server Manager plugin. (SM is for 1.7.x only and yet to be released)

Background History
==================
The first plugin I saw that did this was PingList by Dutch1ee, I used it on my own server for quiet a while until updating to 1.6.4. Sadly the plugin never got updated, that's why I made this plugin, to replace PingList!

This was originally a module from my all-in-one server management plugin, a friend requested the plugin because he also couldn't find one that worked. That is why I stripped this module from the original plugin and am now releasing it to all!
I will release my all-in-one server management plugin under GPLv3 when I feel comfortable with the stability and usability! AKA has a config file and decent commands, currently it's all hard-coded *shame on me* :)

It uses Metrics!
================
This plugin uses Metrics! You can opt-out by editing the file "plugins/PluginMetrics/config.yml"
